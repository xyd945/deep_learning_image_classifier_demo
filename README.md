# deep_learning_image_classifier_demo

This repository includes all the code, files for the deep learning presentation and image classification demo I gave online or offline. Enjoy.

The code and original tutorial can be found also in the tensorflow for poets: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0 , I leveraged the code and tutorial plus some of my slides to make the demo more intuitive and fun:-)
